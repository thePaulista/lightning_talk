staying_alive: quick algorithms for the layperson in cardiovascular emergencies

cover: strokes, heart_attack, cardiac_arrest

why?
every 40 s, someone has a stroke and every 4 min someone dies from it
it's 80% preventable
heart_attack occurs every 43 sec, and every min someone dies from it.

1. stroke = brain_attack
(a) ischemic: blockage due to a clot
    symptoms: facial_weakness, slurred_speech && arm_weakness || leg_weakness
    do: ensure person's safety, call 911, record time, and note symptoms to inform the paramedic

(b) hemorraghic: head bleed due to a leaky vessel
    symptoms: "worst_headache_of_my_life", "thunder_clap_headache"
    do: call 911, do not take aspirin, advil. tylenol may be ok. note time and symptoms

2. heart_attack: no blood flow due to narrowing or occlusion of one of the three arteries in the heart
   typical_symptoms: "crushing" chest_pain, shortness_of_breath, dizziness, jaw_pain, left_arm_pain, back_pain, indigestion, clammy skin.
   atypical_symptoms: general sense of unease with mild combination of the above
   do: call 911, give an aspirin to the person. if a medicine called nitroglycerin is available, give under the tongue (some people with existing cardiac disease carry this).

3. cardiac_arrest: heart stops or quivers so that blood is insufficiently pumped
   typical_symptoms: passed out! - this mean, they are dead.
   do: check response and pulse.
       call 911 or have someone call 911, and bring an AED (automatic external defibrillators)
                (in public places, AEDs are often next to a public phone, if they still exist)
      rule "go hard and fast"
              2 inches down the middle of the chest (between the nipples)
              100 beats per minute (to the tune of staying alive)
              for every 30 compressions, give 2:
                            tilt the head back, so that the airway can open
                            pinch the nostrils, and give a nice steady breath, and peak for a chest rise
              and every 2 minutes, check pulse
      if AED arrives, have the helper set up the AED. Do not stop compressions, until the machine
               instructs to clear for analysis.  

    the likelihood of survival, as well as return to normal functional life, depends on how fast the compressions are started, and the quality of the compressions/breath cycle.
